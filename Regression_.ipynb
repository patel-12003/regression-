        "# What is Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables. It assumes that one variable (the dependent variable-y) is linearly dependent on another variable (the independent variable -X).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: Linearity,Independence,Homoscedasticity,Normality of Errors these are the asssumptions of simple linear regression.\n",

        "\n",
        "# What does the intercept c represent in the equation Y=mX+c?\n",
        "Ans: c is the intercept, and it represents the value of Y when X is equal to zero.\n",

        "# What is the purpose of the least squares method in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: The least squares method in Simple Linear Regression is used to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the observed data points and the predicted values from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  How is the coefficient of determination (R²) interpreted in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: The coefficient of determination, denoted as R² (R-squared), is a key statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a regression model, particularly in simple linear regression.\n",

        "#  What is Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: Multiple Linear Regression contains more than one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is the main difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: The main difference between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression lies in the number of independent variables used to predict the dependent variable.\n",

        "# What is heteroscedasticity, and how does it affect the results of a Multiple Linear Regression model?\n",
        "Ans: Heteroscedasticity is the condition where the variability of the residuals (errors) is not constant across the levels of the independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  How can you improve a Multiple Linear Regression model with high multicollinearity?\n",
        "Ans: Remove One of the Correlated Variables\n",

        "\n",
        "# What is the role of interaction terms in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: In Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), interaction terms play a crucial role by capturing the combined effect of two or more predictors on the dependent variable that cannot be explained by the individual predictors alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How can the interpretation of intercept differ between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: nterpretation can differ significantly between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression, primarily due to the number of predictors and the nature of the relationships being modeled.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is the significance of the slope in regression analysis, and how does it affect predictions?\n",
        "Ans: The slope in regression analysis is a key component of the model that indicates the relationship between the independent variable(s) (predictor) and the dependent variable (outcome). It represents the rate of change of the dependent variable as the independent variable changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How does the intercept in a regression model provide context for the relationship between variables?\n",
        "Ans:  the intercept gives us an important baseline reference point for understanding this relationship.\n",

        "# What are the limitations of using R² as a sole measure of model performance?\n",
        "Ans: Misleading with complex models\n",

        "\n",
        "# How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?\n",

        "\n",
        "# How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it?\n",
        "Ans: Identifying heteroscedasticity in residual plots is crucial because it indicates that the assumption of constant variance of errors is violated, which can lead to inefficient estimates, invalid statistical tests, and unreliable predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# What does it mean if a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but low adjusted R²?\n",
        "Ans: When a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but a low adjusted R², it typically suggests that the model is overfitting the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Ans: Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression is important for several reasons, primarily related to improving the model's performance, interpretation, and the efficiency of the estimation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is polynomial regression?\n",
        "Ans: Polynomial regression is a type of linear regression where the relationship between the independent variabl X and the dependent variable Y is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial rather than a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  How does polynomial regression differ from linear regression?\n",
